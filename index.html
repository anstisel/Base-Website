            <h1>About Me </h1>
            <p> I am currently in my penultimate year of study at the University of Western Australia, completing a Bachelor of Science and double majoring in Software Engineering and English and Literary Studies. I am highly articulate and confident in working in collaborative environments and with diverse cultures, as proven through my experience within university group-projects and my professional experience within hospitality and retail.  </p>
            <p> I enjoy working analytically to address solutions and using mathematical theory to develop efficient and readable software.  I am most confident working in C, and have advanced knowledge of Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite. I have extensive experience implementing my analytical skills to technical projects, formulated in relevant coursework such as Data Structures and Algorithms and Systems Programming. Previous software I have developed includes programs that analyse statistical data for COVID-19 cases in Python, a stack-based simulation with both cache and main memory in C and a C program which receives command-line options to traverse trajectories, counting files and detecting duplicates.
              As my previous work experience at Little Way Café, Grill’d, and Boost Juice are all heavily centred around customer service and teamwork, I place great significance on the importance of positive engagement, collaboration, and shared success amongst peers. I also have experience working independently in retail and within university, which has pressed upon me the importance of being able to handle decision-making processes and achieve goals independently if needed. 
              </p>

              <p> Please note that this is an incredibly rudimentary example of my work in web development. Please see my TAWC-New-Power website developed for the University of Queensland in <a href="https://github.com/anstisel"> my github repository.</a></p>
